## Description
Tuter let's families connect with prospective tutors near them. Tutors will be able to login with their personal account which will display their availability as well as subjects. Families can then login and sign up for time slots, leave notes for the tutor to review, and upload images of homework or problems to work on.
BONUS: Many families that Sarah works with are Korean, so the website will support Korean comments.

## Installation & Usage
Please check back in the near future for updates and a deployed website!
